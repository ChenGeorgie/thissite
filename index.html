            Update: This answer has gotten far more attention than it deserves.  It was originally posted because I think the graphs look nice and they could be drawn-over in Illustrator for a publicationâ€“ and there was no better solution.  But there now exists much more applicable answers to this Q, such as fracz's, Jubobs', or Harry Lee's!  Please go upvote those!!!!
